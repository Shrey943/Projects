Two market orders matched.
(ord003 despite being a market order could not be matched with ord002 because
both are indivisible.)
The execution price is determined by the previous transaction price.
Since this is the first transaction, the last price (first line in the file)
is used.
Note that the resulting residual order now fits exactly the quantity of
an indivisible order and is therefore matched.
